Create a comprehensive D3.js (version 7) datatable implementation for the Chocolate Sales dataset with the following functionality:

1. Data Processing(Manipulation):
   - Load and parse CSV data with proper type conversion (dates, numeric values)
   - Group and summarize data as needed
   - Structure the data for efficient filtering and sorting

2. Visual Desgin(Mapping):
   - Create a clean HTML table structure with headers and pagination
   - Implement responsive design with appropriate CSS styling
   - Add visual indicators for sorting direction and active filters

3. Rendering and Interaction:
   - Column sorting (ascending/descending) when clicking headers
   - Text-based filtering for each column (input boxes in header)
   - Dropdown filters for categorical columns (Country, Product, Sales Person)
   - Global search across all columns
   - Pagination with configurable page size

4. Code Organization:
   - Use modern JavaScript practices with clear variable names
   - Separate concerns (data processing, rendering, event handling)
   - Add detailed comments explaining each functional section
   - Include error handling for data loading failures

Here's a sample of the CSV data structure:

Sales Person,Country,Product,Date,Amount,Boxes Shipped
Jehu Rudeforth,UK,Mint Chip Choco,04-Jan-22,"$5,320",180
Van Tuxwell,India,85% Dark Bars,01-Aug-22,"$7,896",94

Please provide the complete implementation as three separate code blocks: HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic, with comments explaining key implementation decisions.
